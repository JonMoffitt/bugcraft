bugcraft
========

Bugcraft is a mod for minecraft 1.6.  

Bugcraft adds a number of insect species to the standard minecraft world
It also adds a number of new blocks that allow players to catch, research, and even create new species of insects

This mod uses Minecraft Forge and ModLoader.

To contribute to this mod you will need to do the following

1) Buy a license for minecraft if you do not have it already.  

2) Create a new folder for this repository.  I would suggest using the format "C:\modding\github\accountName\"

3) Clone this repository to that location.  If you used the suggested folder from step 2, 
you should end up with a directory structure like this "C:\modding\github\account_name\bugcraft" 

3) download the latest minecraft forge source from the [forge download page] (
http://www.minecraftforge.net/forum/index.php/topic,5.0.html.)

4) Extract it to the bugcraft folder created in step 3.  If you used the suggested folder from step 2
you should now have a fully hydrated folder at "C:\modding\github\account_name\bugcraft\forge"

5) copy [minecraft.exe] (https://s3.amazonaws.com/Minecraft.Download/versions/1.7.2/minecraft_server.1.7.2.exe)
   and [minecraft_server.1.7.2.jar] (https://s3.amazonaws.com/Minecraft.Download/versions/1.7.2/minecraft_server.1.7.2.jar)
   to the bugcraft folder from step 3.
   
6) If you do not have eclipse, download the installer from [here] (http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/epp/downloads/release/kepler/SR1/eclipse-standard-kepler-SR1-win32-x86_64.zip)

7) At this point you should be ready to start modding.  Run eclipse.  When prompted for a workspace, 
use relative path "/mcp/eclipse".  If you used the suggested folder structure, you would enter
"C:\modding\github\account_name\bugcraft\forge\mcp\eclipse"

8) Congratulations!  You are ready to test the mod, click the play button.  
The minecraft client should launch.
If everything is setup properly you should see the following when you click the "mods" button.

"Minecraft Coder Pack"
"Forge Mod Loader"
"Minecraft Forge"
"Bug Craft"
